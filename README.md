# Tip-Calculator

# Info

Hello, this is a tip calculator for users to use when they have a bill that they need to calculate, whether it being a restaraunt bill or even activity bills. You have an input range where you can change how much % you want to give to the waiter. You can also use the custom tip where you just add a specific $. You can also always leave it blank if you do not want to tip.

Theres a function where you can divide it with the party size of your group and it shows you how much per person it is. 

#Techs Used

Javascript - Created functions for the tip calculator that dealt with many mathematical equations to get the total bill + tip to be correct on the DOM. Created Event Listeners for the Custom tip button, for once it is pressed, the custom amount of $ will go towards the total amount. Created a function where it would divide the the total bill and with how many people are in the party which will then calculate how much money each person has to pay equally.

HTML - Created a header, and a body with a calculator on the left hand side and a tip calculator on the right hand side. 

CSS - Added a bunch of CSS to make the calculator look readable and understandable. Made it responsive so that if this was looked on a different resolution, the website wouldn't bug out.
